# Installing a Python dev environment

## git and github

- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
(choose [git bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on Windows): git is a versioning system used to manage the source code of software projects such as scikit-learn and numpy.

- [Create an account on github.com](https://github.com): github is a platform to work collaboratively on the source code of hosted Open Source projects such as scikit-learn and NumPy.

- [Create an SSH key for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) 

Once you have a github account and installed the `git` command on your system, open a new terminal session (use Git Bash under Windows) type the following commands.

- Fork scikit-learn in the github web interace: go to https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn and click the "fork" button. You should be automatically redirected to your personal fork at:  https://github.com/myusername/scikit-learn in your web browser.

- Then, in the terminal clone your fork with git using your ssh agent:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:myusername/scikit-learn.git
```

- Many open source projects from the Python ecosystem share similar development practices. For instance, you can also (optionally) clone numpy with git if you want to use the development version of numpy instead of a released package:
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:myusername/numpy/numpy.git
  ```
  
- After cloning those repo, you should see a new local folders with your clones in the output of the `ls` command:

  ```
  $ ls
  ```
  
- To locate those folder, use the `pwd` (path to working directory) command:

  ```
  $ pwd
  ```

- Configure some aliases for the remote repositories:

  List existing aliases in your scikit-learn clone:
  ```
  $ cd scikit-learn
  $ git remote -v
  ```
  
  Add a new alias for your fork on github:
  ```
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
  ```
  
  Check that your new alias has been properly configured:
  ```
  $ git remote -v
  ```

## conda

Conda is a command line tool to download software packages and work in isolated environements for different projects.

The fastest way to install the conda tool is to use a miniconda installer.

### Install miniconda

- Install miniconda from
[the official installation page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (choose the latest Miniconda installer links)
- Initialize the conda command in git bash
  - Windows: open "Git Bash" and type
  ```
  $ ./Miniconda3/Scripts/conda init bash
  ```
  - Linux & macOS:
  ```
  $ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh #bash YOUR-FILE.sh
  $ conda init bash
  ```
- then close your shell and start a new one to type:
  
  ```
  $ conda info
  ```
  or
  
  ```
  $ which conda
  ```
  to check that the conda command is in your PATH and useable from your shell.

### conda environments

conda environments make it possible to have specific versions of your packages to work on a specific project independently of the dependencies used for other projects. Once your are done with a project it's very easy to delete a conda environment to avoid accumulating packages you no longer need on your system.

conda environments also make it easy to make sure that the versions of the packages you use on your developer environment matchs those used by your team members or those required by the production environment for instance.

- create an environment named `sklworkshop`:
```
$ conda create --name sklworkshop python=3.9 numpy scipy cython
```
- activate and deactivate environments
```
$ conda activate sklworkshop
(sklworkshop)$ conda deactivate
```
- version, environment and package listing
```
$ conda --version
$ conda env list
$ conda list
```

## VS Code

VS Code is a very popular open source code editor with a rich set of extensions to turn it into a full fledged Integrated Development Environment (with fast code navigation, auto completion, pytest execution, debugger, jupyter notebook editing and execution...).

Here we show the main tips and tricks to get productive when using VS Code to work on Python projects such as scikit-learn (including the most useful keyboard shortcuts).

Install VSCode following the
[instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview#_cross-platform) for your Operating System.

Launch VSCode. At the first start you might get a popup to ask you to configure [Telemetry settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry).

Install the Python extension
- `Ctrl+Shift+X` open the extension manager
- search for the python extension: install

Open project folder for numpy: `Ctrl-k Ctrl-o` 

Open a Python file from the project: `setup.py`.

In order to work with VSCode in your Python environment
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` then "python select interpreter" and choose "sklworkshop"

Open project folder for scikit-learn: `Ctrl-k Ctrl-o`

Activate the "sklworkshop" Python interpreter for the scikit-learn project.

Switch between projects: `Ctrl-r`

Browse the code:
- by files `Ctrl-p`
- by symbols `Ctrl-t`

At some point VSCode will complain about not finding a linter: scikit-learn uses `flake8`
- Install `flake8` in your conda environment
```
$ conda activate sklworkshop
(sklworkshop)$ conda install flake8
```
- Select `flake8` as a linter in VSCode: `Ctrl-Shift-P` "select linter"

## Practical code navigation

Find example files that mention the word "importance" in different ways:
- VSCode: `Ctrl-p` "example importance" and open `plot_permutation_importance.py`
- Github: go to https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn in your browser, press `t` and type "example/importance"

Navigate to the RandomForestClassifier from the `plot_permutation_importance.py` example:
- VSCode: ctrl-clicking on the class name
- github: clicking on the class name

Find the class KMeans in scikit-learn in two different ways:
- from the command line, in a bash terminal: using `git grep "class KMeans"` (note that using the "class" prefix makes the search more specific to only find the line of the class definition. Otherwise you will find all occurrences of the KMeans class, including in documentation, tests, examples...). When your are not sure about the casing, use the `git grep -i "keyword"` for case insensitive search instead.
- VSCode: `Ctrl-t` KMeans (disable the jedi extension if it doesn't work)

## Installing C/C++ compilers to be able to build native extensions

Building scikit-learn from source requires a C/C++ compiler (to build native extensions
typically written in Cython for instance).

If you have never installed a C/C++ compiler for your system you need to do it now.

**macOS users:**  you do not need to do anything as there is a compiler installed by default on this
system and it should be enough for the sprint. The scikit-learn build instructions link below gives
more details on how to install OpenMP support for macOS users but this is possibly complex
to setup and not required for the sprint.

See instructions for your OS in the [installation guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#building-from-source).
- [Windows](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#windows)
- [macOS](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#macos) (optional)
- [Linux](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#linux)
